I hope you are doing well.

I recently came across your job posting for the {role} position in {location}, and I am highly interested in this opportunity. With extensive experience in C#, .NET, RESTful APIs, SQL databases,and front-end technologies like Vue.js/React/Angular, I believe my skills align well with the role requirements.

I have attached my resume for your review. I would love to discuss how my expertise can contribute to your team‚Äôs success. Please let me know a convenient time for a quick call.

Looking forward to your response.
